Financial statements requests are limited by TWS to several requests per minute. Therefore it is necessary to avoid loading statements from TWS whenever
possible, i.e. to store the response locally and use it until it is outdated. Then it must retrieved from TWS again.

Financial statements retrieved from TWS are stored in file system and kept forever so that analysis of historical data can be done efficiently.
File with financial statements is considered outdated if it's date plus the number of months of interim income statements plus two months is older then the
current date.
